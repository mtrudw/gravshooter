This is a small multiplayer game made in Godot for Miz Jam 1 on itch.io
There are three parts to this:
- The game itself as a godot project
- A REST API to add and find active servers in the 'api' folder
- The signalining server used to negotiate a peer to peer connection between players in the 'server_node' folder. This is taken from the Godot examples

Please note that the Jam Version shouldn't be taken as a copy and paste example. This is a very rushed, hacked together game made in less than 30 hours without prior knowlege of Multiplayer in Godot.
I'll keep working on the game and keep it open source so over time the code should become a little less buggy and a little prettier.
